### Hello world!

I'm Espe, a PhD student in Psycholinguistics at PPLS (University of Edinburgh). In my research, I look at how disfluencies in speech impact L1 and L2 processing with a focus on lexical prediction and pragmatic interpretation. Currently, I'm on a SGSSS Internship to collaborate with Ghent University on a project looking at the processing of the discourse particle 'er' in Dutch.

I usually work on Python, OpenSesame and R for my research. On the side, I co-organise the Psycholinguistics Coffee with Greta Gandolfi and I teach at PPLS and Usher Institute. At the moment, we are currently organising an event to bring together ECR and PGT working on Psycholinguistics to create a space for all of us to discuss research, and share our experiences and knowledge on building a career in Academia and how to improve our work and how we conduct it (you can check it out [here](https://linkedi2022.github.io/)).
