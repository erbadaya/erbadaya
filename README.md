### Hello world!

I'm Espe, a Post-doctoral research assistant at the Department of Experimental Psychology at Ghent University, where I do research while helping with the eye-tracking lab. I am currectly interested in all things related to paralinguistic cues in communication and social cognition (with a focus on interlocutors' linguistic backgrounds). I previously did my PhD in Psycholinguistics at PPLS (University of Edinburgh), where I looked at how disfluencies in speech impact L1 and L2 processing with a focus on lexical prediction and pragmatic interpretation.
